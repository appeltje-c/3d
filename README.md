Educational ideas
===

- Waste/pollution game
- Quiz
- Visualizations
- 

Scan the barcode of a product, a 3d model is loaded with some initial stats and a score. <br/>
You can click on the different parts of the model to get more information (see below)

Visualize where your product comes from and where it goes to: <br/>

e.g. a bottle of coca cola:
- the cap
- the label
- the bottle itself
- the contents

Click on a part of the model and it tells you:
- how much is produced every year (compare with graspable visuals, landmarks, animals)
- how much is recycled every year
- a footprint score for the product?
-
